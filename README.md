## Introduction

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. The objective is to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This implementation of Hangman is written in [Programming Language], making it easy to run on most platforms.

## Features

- Text-based interface
- Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Word list can be easily updated or customized
- Tracks and displays the number of wrong guesses
- Displays the correctly guessed letters in their respective positions
- Simple and easy-to-understand codebase

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Programming Language] installed on your machine
- A command-line interface (CLI) or terminal

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hangman-game
    ```
3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    [command to run the game]
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the game using the command mentioned in the installation steps.
2. The game will display the number of letters in the word and ask you to guess a letter.
3. Type a letter and press Enter.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
5. If the letter is not in the word, it will count as a wrong guess, and the hangman figure will start to appear.
6. Continue guessing until you either reveal the entire word or the hangman figure is fully drawn.

## Game Rules

- The player must guess the hidden word one letter at a time.
- The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (typically 6-8).
- If the player guesses all letters correctly before running out of attempts, they win.
- If the player runs out of attempts before guessing the word, they lose.
